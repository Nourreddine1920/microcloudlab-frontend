# Board Selection Logic Implementation

## Overview
This implementation ensures that users must first select a development board before they can access peripheral configuration tools. This logical flow prevents configuration errors and provides a better user experience.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. BoardContext (`src/contexts/BoardContext.jsx`)
- **Purpose**: Global state management for selected board
- **Features**:
  - Persistent board selection using localStorage
  - Available boards configuration with peripheral categories
  - Board selection, clearing, and retrieval functions
  - Loading state management

### 2. ProtectedRoute Component (`src/components/ProtectedRoute.jsx`)
- **Purpose**: Route protection that requires board selection
- **Features**:
  - Redirects to IDE home when no board is selected
  - Shows loading spinner during board state check
  - Passes redirect messages to inform users

### 3. Updated IDE Home Page (`src/pages/ide/index.jsx`)
- **Purpose**: Enhanced board selection interface
- **Features**:
  - Integration with BoardContext
  - Display of redirect messages when users try to access protected pages
  - Board selection persistence
  - Current board indicator
  - Direct navigation to peripheral dashboard after board selection

### 4. Updated Peripheral Dashboard (`microcloudlab_ide/src/pages/peripheral-configuration-dashboard/index.jsx`)
- **Purpose**: Board-specific peripheral configuration
- **Features**:
  - Dynamic peripheral data based on selected board
  - Board-specific titles and descriptions
  - Quick board change option
  - Contextual peripheral categories

### 5. Protected Routes Configuration (`src/Routes.jsx`)
- **Routes protected**:
  - `/ide/configuration-validation-conflicts`
  - `/ide/configuration-import-export-manager`
  - `/ide/peripheral-configuration-editor`
  - `/ide/pin-assignment-visualizer`
  - `/ide/peripheral-configuration-dashboard`

## User Flow

1. **Initial Access**: User navigates to IDE home page
2. **Board Selection Required**: User sees available boards and must select one
3. **Board Selection**: User clicks on a board to select it
4. **State Persistence**: Selection is saved to localStorage
5. **Access Granted**: User can now access peripheral configuration tools
6. **Redirect Protection**: If user tries to access protected pages without board selection, they're redirected back to IDE home with a message
7. **Board Context**: All protected pages show board-specific data and options

## Technical Implementation Details

### State Management
- Uses React Context API for global state
- localStorage for persistence across sessions
- Loading states for smooth UX

### Route Protection
- Higher-order component pattern
- Automatic redirects with state preservation
- User-friendly error messages

### Board Configuration
Each board includes:
- Basic information (name, description, specs)
- Peripheral categories (communication, gpio, timers, analog, system)
- Specific peripheral lists per category
- Configuration metadata

### Data Flow
1. User selects board → Context updates → localStorage saves
2. Navigation attempt → ProtectedRoute checks → Allow/Redirect
3. Protected page loads → Reads board from context → Shows board-specific data

## Benefits

1. **Logical Flow**: Users must choose hardware before configuration
2. **Error Prevention**: Prevents invalid configurations for wrong boards
3. **Better UX**: Clear guidance and contextual information
4. **Persistence**: Selection persists across browser sessions
5. **Flexibility**: Easy to add new boards and configurations
6. **Maintainability**: Centralized board data and logic

## Testing the Implementation

1. Navigate to `/ide` - should show board selection
2. Try accessing `/ide/peripheral-configuration-dashboard` directly - should redirect with message
3. Select a board and click "Start with Board" - should navigate to dashboard
4. Dashboard should show board-specific title and peripherals
5. Refresh page - board selection should persist
6. Click "Change Board" - should return to selection page

## Future Enhancements

1. **Board Validation**: Verify board availability before access
2. **Configuration Sync**: Sync configurations across different boards
3. **Board Templates**: Pre-configured templates for common use cases
4. **Multi-Board Projects**: Support for projects using multiple boards
5. **Board Simulation**: Virtual board simulation for testing
